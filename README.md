# Horiseon Webpage

## My take on improving the Horiseon Webpage
In this assignment I improved a broken link (The "Search Engine Optimization" link in the top-right corner of the page), cleaned up the CSS by deleting redundant code, and changed some visual elements to make the page a little more streamlined and easier to navigate.
